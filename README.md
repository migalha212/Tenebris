# LDTS T14G01 - TENEBRIS  

## Game Description

> A character named Dylan Macron finds himself jumping from arena to arena, fighting for his life. Each arena is filled with monsters of various types, all determined to kill him. Starting out relatively powerless, Dylan grows stronger with each fight as he gains experience. He has two weapons at his disposal: a simple Pistol and a Grenade Launcher. Dylan has only one life per level. If he dies, he will respawn at the beginning of the level and can continue fighting. However, if he dies on the hardest difficulty level, it’s game over.
